Karamoja is the most food-insecure region of Uganda. One of the main reasons is the low productivity level of the crops due to intense droughts as well as pest and disease outbreaks.

As a Data Scientist, i decided to create a dashboard thayt could give a brief overview of the Crop yield per counties and sub-counties of Karamoja.
